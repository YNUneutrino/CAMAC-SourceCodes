# CAMAC Source Codes at B103 in YNU Engineering Lab
These source codes can operate CAMAC modules at B103 in YNU Engineering laboratory building.
You can operate CAMAC modules in other places if you change a few parts of each code.  

## CAMAC Operation Codes
- We have CAMAC modules written below.  
- Write what we care

### General process
- Use a program
- Enter "make (filename without an extension)"
- Object file and execute file are made then

### ADC: Analog Digital Convertor
#### 2249W(LeCroy)
- General ADC module
- You use 2249w
- You need to change station number and channel number list when you use this
-

#### C009(HOSHIN)

### TDC: Time Digital Convertor
C-TS105(Technoland), RPC-061(REPIC)

### Combine ADC with TDC

### Other Modules
Other modules
- Output Register (C004(HOSHIN))  
- Input Register (C005(HOSHIN))  
- Scaler (?)
